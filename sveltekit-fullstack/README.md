## Why i would use svelte
![](../githubImg/sv-rc.png)

- a fresh take on modern web development with everything in one place
- it's more of a compiler than a framework - no virtual doms, compiles to js
- simpler, faster, leaner, easier stack and the best thing.. no boilerplate code
- first-class server-side rendering support - arguably costs less because SSR is faster, so compute reqs would be lower
- a lot of companies are starting to use sveltekit in dev

## React vs Sveltekit
- React uses more cpu power, which means more electricity usage, so if you use it you want to kill turtles
